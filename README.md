# Inventory
**Capstone Project IV**

A store manager is responsible for managing the warehouse and, more importantly, performing stock-taking. To optimise delivery time and improve organisation, I created an inventory program using my Python knowledge to get an overview of each stock-taking session.


Warehouses store the following information for each stock-taking list:
  
  ● Country
  ● Code
  ● Product
  ● Cost
  ● Quantity
  ● Value


Other store managers (in other regions) can use the program to do the following:
 
  ● Search products by code.
  ● Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it.
  ● Determine the product with the highest quantity.
  ● Calculate the total value of each stock item. The total value is calculated by multiplying the cost by the quantity of each item entered into the      system.
